                The gestures and metaphors of icon-driven computing feel so natural and effortless to us now, it
                seems strange to recall navigating in the digital world any other way. Until Apple’s debut of the
                Macintosh in 1984, however, most of our interactions with computers based on text commands system.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
                Susan Kare Kare was born in Ithaca, New York February 5, 1954[1]. After taking painting lessons as a
                young girl and graduating from New York University with a Ph.D. in fine arts, Kare moved to the Bay
                Area, where she took a curatorial job at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. But she quickly
                felt like she was on the wrong side of the creative equation. "I’d go talk to artists in their
                studios for exhibitions,” she recalls, “but I really wanted to be working in my studio."
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually Kare earned a commission from an Arkansas museum to sculpt a razorback hog out of steel.
                That was the project she was tackling in her garage in Palo Alto when she got a call from a
                high-school friend named Andy Hertzfeld, who was the lead software architect for the Macintosh
                operating system, offering her a job.[2]

                <h3>Timeless Icon Art</h3>
                <p>
                    Susan Kare created some of the world’s most recognizable icon art. Her designs for the original
                    Apple Mac were friendly, whimsical, quirky, and soulful — making a huge contribution to the
                    emotional connection that many Apple users formed with their Mac, and enhancing the user
                    experience in the process. Kare invented new symbol conventions, such as the fill bucket and
                    lasso tool, which have since become ubiquitous in graphics applications.[3]

                <h3>Iconic Fonts</h3>
                <p>
                    She also designed the iconic Chicago font (featured in the header image above). In spite of it
                    being her first ever typeface design, the font powered Mac OS for years. It was one of the first
                    proportional (i.e. not fixed width) system fonts used on any platform. Like her icons, the font
                    was functional and highly legible — but also friendly and distinctive.[3]

                <h3>Squared Canvas</h3>
                <p>
                    She designed the Mac icons in a $2.50 squared notebook. Icon design programs were not yet a
                    thing in the 1980s, so Kare began on paper. Which is lucky for us, because it means we have the
                    privilege of seeing her original sketches. For many Susan Kare remains one of the most
                    influential contemporary designers.[3]
