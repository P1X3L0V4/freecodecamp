Using Apple computers then and now was so intuitive because of her: Susan Kare 
Building on the GUI inspired by Adele Goldberg's team at PARC, the graphic designer Susan Kare is responsible for what remain some of Apple's signature graphics to this day. First, she took on Steve Jobs' directive to create a sleeker font for Apple — one that gave each letter its due amount of pixels, and didn't attempt to make each uniform in the amount of space it took up (like a typewriter).

Kare also developed the idea that the graphics should be easily readable symbols, correlating to real world objects. This resulted in the Apple clock, the pointer finger, the trash can, and more. Even the Apple "command" key was of Kare's design, inspired by a Swedish symbol for a castle.
